# Cognitive Planning with LLMs

> **Status**: This chapter is under development. Check back in Iteration 2 for complete content.

## Overview

This chapter will explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for high-level task planning, reasoning, and decision-making in autonomous robotics.

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) for robot planning
- Implement chain-of-thought reasoning for complex tasks
- Design prompt engineering strategies for robotics
- Handle planning failures and replanning scenarios

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of voice-to-action systems
- Experience with LLM APIs
- Knowledge of task planning algorithms (helpful)
