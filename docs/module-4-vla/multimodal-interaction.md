# Multi-modal Interaction (Speech, Gesture, Vision)

> **Status**: This chapter is under development. Check back in Iteration 2 for complete content.

## Overview

This chapter will cover multi-modal interaction systems that combine speech, gesture recognition, and vision to create natural human-robot interfaces.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement gesture recognition for robot control
- Fuse speech, vision, and gesture modalities
- Design intuitive human-robot interaction workflows
- Build a capstone project: The Autonomous Humanoid

## Prerequisites

- Completed all previous chapters in Module 4
- Understanding of sensor fusion techniques
- Experience with real-time systems

---

**Capstone Project**: Build an autonomous humanoid robot that integrates ROS 2, simulation (Gazebo/Unity), NVIDIA Isaac AI, and VLA models for natural human interaction.
