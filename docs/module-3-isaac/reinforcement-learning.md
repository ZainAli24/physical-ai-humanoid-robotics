# Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control

> **Status**: This chapter is under development. Check back in Iteration 2 for complete content.

## Overview

This chapter will explore reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for training robots to perform complex tasks using NVIDIA Isaac Gym and Isaac Sim.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand RL fundamentals (PPO, SAC, TD3)
- Set up Isaac Gym for massively parallel RL training
- Train robots to walk, grasp, and manipulate objects
- Implement sim-to-real transfer strategies

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of AI-powered perception
- Machine learning background (neural networks, optimization)
- Python programming (PyTorch or TensorFlow knowledge helpful)
