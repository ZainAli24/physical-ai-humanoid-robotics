# Physics Simulation (Gravity, Collisions)

> **Status**: This chapter is under development. Check back in Iteration 2 for complete content.

## Overview

This chapter will cover physics simulation in Gazebo, including gravity, collisions, friction, and other physical phenomena critical for realistic robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives

- Configure physics engines (ODE, Bullet, Simbody)
- Implement collision detection and response
- Tune friction and contact parameters
- Simulate sensor physics (LiDAR, cameras, IMU)

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Gazebo simulation environment
- Basic physics knowledge (forces, torques, dynamics)
